ATM operation emulator

The operations that the ATM supports are as follows:
•	deposit money, 
•	withdraw money, 
•	show the status of the ATM.

The ATM also supports multicurrency. 
Our ATM is user friendly, so if the user does not have enough banknotes to withdraw the required amount, they will be notified about it.
